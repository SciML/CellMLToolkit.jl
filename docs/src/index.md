# CellMLToolkit.jl

CellMLToolkit.jl is a Julia library that connects CellML models to the Scientific Julia ecosystem. CellMLToolkit.jl acts as a bridge between CellML and ModelingToolkit.jl. It imports a CellML model (in XML) and emits a ModelingToolkit.jl intermediate representation (IR), which can then enter the SciML ecosystem.

## CellML

[CellML](http://cellml.org) is an XML-based open-standard for the exchange of mathematical models. CellML originally started in 1998 by the Auckland Bioengineering Institute at the University of Auckland and affiliated research groups. Since then, its [repository](https://models.physiomeproject.org/welcome) has grown to more than a thousand models. While CellML is not domain-specific, its focus has been on biomedical models. Currently, the active categories in the repository are *Calcium Dynamics*, *Cardiovascular Circulation*, *Cell Cycle*, *Cell Migration*, *Circadian Rhythms*, *Electrophysiology*, *Endocrine*, *Excitation-Contraction Coupling*, *Gene Regulation*, *Hepatology*, *Immunology*, *Ion Transport*, *Mechanical Constitutive Laws*, *Metabolism*, *Myofilament Mechanics*, *Neurobiology*, *pH Regulation*, *PKPD*, *Protein Modules*, *Signal Transduction*, and *Synthetic Biology*. There are many software tools to import, process and run CellML models; however, these tools are not Julia-specific.

## SciML

[SciML](http://github.com/SciML) is a collection of Julia libraries for open source scientific computing and machine learning. The centerpiece of SciML is [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl), which provides a rich set of ordinary differential equations (ODE) solvers. One major peripheral component of SciML is [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl). It is a modeling framework for high-performance symbolic-numeric computation in scientific computing and scientific machine learning. The core of ModelingToolkit.jl is an IR language to code the scientific problems of interest in a high level. Automatic code generation and differentiation allow for the generation of a usable model for the other components of SciML, such as DifferentialEquations.jl.

## Install

To install, run

```julia
  Pkg.add("CellMLToolkit")
```

## Example

```Julia
  using CellMLToolkit, DifferentialEquations, Plots

  ml = CellModel("models/lorenz.cellml.xml")

  tspan = (0, 100.0)
  prob = ODEProblem(ml, tspan)
  sol = solve(prob, TRBDF2(), dtmax=0.01)
  X = map(x -> x[1], sol.u)
  Z = map(x -> x[3], sol.u)
  plot(X, Z)
```
